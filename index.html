        <h2 id="Why_another_comparison">Why another comparison</h2><p>I’m currently looking for gainful employment as a Linux System<br>Administrator/DevOps Engineer.  Regardless of the company I interview at the<br>senior DevOps engineer, or senior software developer will utter something of<br>the following,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just so many definitions for what DevOps is.  It just doesn’t have<br>a fixed definition of any kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is irksome to me, and points to potential communication and education<br>issues within the company.</p>
<p>From my reading and research DevOps has a broad but well defined definition<br>with very specific and wide ranging implications on best practices for the life<br>cycle of a project - development , deployment, and operation management.  There<br>are several pioneers and I won’t name them all but I’ll name the one’s that<br>have personally profoundly affected my thinking on the subject Martin Fowler,<br>Jez Humble, and Gene Kim, and well there are many more but those are the one’s<br>that first blew my mind.  A good working definition is through the mnemonic<br>device:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong> - a group <strong>culture</strong></li>
<li><strong>A</strong> - using <strong>automation</strong> to remove unnecessary work</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> - applying <strong>Lean</strong> development practices to the entire project, infrastructure included</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> - using <strong>measurement</strong> or <strong>metrics</strong> into the decision making process</li>
<li><strong>S</strong> - <strong>Sharing</strong> among historical silos: Dev. and Ops. as primary examples</li>
</ul>
<p>A few good websites that quickly tl;dr’s DevOps are New Relic’s<br>page on the <a href="http://newrelic.com/devops/lifecycle" target="_blank" rel="external">DevOps lifecyle</a> and <a href="https://blog.appdynamics.com/devops/keep-calm-embrace-devops-culture/" target="_blank" rel="external">AppDynamics</a> definition of DevOps through the above acronym, CALMS.</p>
<h2 id="So_it’s_not_a_tile">So it’s not a tile</h2><p>DevOps isn’t a title.  A company can certainly have DevOps ambassadors<br>however isolating a DevOps team is antithetical to the entire notion of what<br>DevOps is.  That is if nothing else an alternative poor mans approach to<br>determine what DevOps is, is by understanding what it isn’t.  Really quite fine<br>web pages concerning the nature of DevOps as an outlook as opposed to<br>a division are Pete Cheslock’s blog article <a href="https://pete.wtf/2013/05/03/devops-in-your-job-title-is-doing-you-harm/" target="_blank" rel="external">DevOps in Your Job Title Is Doing You Harm</a><br>and Jez Humble’s </p>

<p><a href="https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/transcript-stop-hiring-devops-experts-start-growing" target="_blank" rel="external">Stop Hiring DevOps Experts and Start Growing Them</a></p>
<h2 id="So_I_don’t_care_what_you_call_me_as_long_as_…">So I don’t care what you call me as long as …</h2><p>That is there are implications when I claim on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yigalweinstein" target="_blank" rel="external">LinkedIn</a> that I’m a “DevOps<br>advocate”.  The first is that I don’t need to have DevOps in the title to be<br>part of a DevOps community.  Linux administration as part of the IT workforce is<br>just as much a part of the DevOps movement as the title DevOps engineer.  In<br>principal it’s about how the company and its IT workers function.  Nothing is<br>perfect, and most companies are incrementally designing their work flow to be<br>more in line with a DevOps paradigm, and the simple reason for this is that it<br>works.  I aim to be of use in knowing how to properly use technology, but in<br>a manner that will positively affect the dev-ops (-business-client) work flow,<br>which includes stability, high availability, scalability etc. in relation to<br>infrastructure and the part I play in the whole.</p>

        <h2 id="Retrospective,_expectations,_honesty_and_work">Retrospective, expectations, honesty and work</h2><p>A bit more than 6 months have past since I made the choice to part companies<br>with Rackspace.  It’s been a time of self reflection, examination, and<br>a reality check and while the outcome is different than I expected it’s time to<br>synthesize what I have learned and make the best choice given my goals, and<br>limitations.  To sum things up I got scared as I’m prone to do of commitment<br>and was not in the right state to make a rational decision when I left and well<br>it was a lesson if nothing else than in humility.  I can write all day how<br>I still think big data, and data science are and will become ever more so<br>a transformative tool but so is devops.  It’s not easy to write but through<br>observing how I actually want to spend my time, what I’ve concluded after<br>6 months of self observation is that I’m intrinsically better suited, and<br>therefore more capable at devops than data science.  Not only is this the case<br>but I enjoy the tasks of devops more than that of data science, e.g. building<br>a stable dynamic infrastructure over learning a new machine language algorithm.</p>
<p>I’m not irredeemably bad, at least in my own mind.  I certainly had plenty of<br>time to practice my Python coding skills, and the statistics, and machine<br>learning I worked on was certainly fascinating, and I suspect will be useful in<br>many projects I plan to attempt in the future.  That being the case I have no<br>doubt that I have commitment issues but I’ve stuck to things in the past, my MS<br>degree, and 4 years of being a professional system administrator/devops<br>engineer, and well it’s time to accept that I made a mistake six months ago,<br>and pick myself up and start job hunting again. Working graveyard shift has<br>made me aware that while I’m fine with night rotations full graveyard work is<br>to be avoided if at all possible.  So in the last couple of days I’ve updated<br>my LinkedIn, completed my Hired.com profile, and am actively starting to apply<br>for positions.</p>
<h2 id="When_I_decided_to_change_directions:">When I decided to change directions:</h2><p>So I gave notice that in two weeks I would resign from my position at Rackspace<br>two weeks ago.  I think it useful at this stage to provide what motivated me,<br>and where I plan to go now that the smoke has cleared.  First for the shock and<br>horror, I didn’t secure a job for myself prior to leaving.  Initially I wrote<br>a somewhat flowery piece about how I found my calling, and how this was somehow<br>a pinnacle of self achievement.  I think it’s important to be as honest as<br>possible regarding life changing decisions.  There were two areas that were<br>a deal breaker working at Rackspace.  The first was that I was working<br>graveyard shift.  For people who aren’t naturally night owls working these<br>hours is draining, and it only gets worse as time progresses.  A decreased<br>mental and physical state were scary to me.  </p>
<p>For my sanity I realized that working night shift wasn’t something I was<br>willing to do anymore.   In a bit over two and half years that I worked for<br>Rackspace I gained 30 pounds, lost muscle mass,  my stress relief changed from<br>a daily Yoga practice to drinking beer, and I no longer had the energy to learn<br>new skills and that was just unacceptable.  I also couldn’t participate in<br>group pursuits I had great interest in that fell outside of work not only<br>because most events overlapped with when I was sleeping or working but moreover<br>I simply didn’t have enough energy to participate in them.  Not to bring to the<br>surface all of my insecurities but I’m a mid-thirties something who is very<br>much a bachelor only half by choice.  Working those hours certainly doesn’t<br>help in my search for a partner in crime.  So romantically describing a desire<br>to move to data science doesn’t properly reflect the situation I found myself<br>in nor why I decided to resign.</p>
<p>I was given the opportunity by my manager, and I’m honestly truly thankful to<br>her for trusting in my character and skill set, of moving to a first shift job<br>at Rackspace in the same capacity as I had worked on third.  I love<br>collaborating to create technical solutions however there were several profound<br>limitations with this position.  First I love optimizing algorithms, finding<br>meaning from data, understanding what equations mean in a functional sense, and<br>the challenges, and rewards that working with big data provides.  There was no<br>way of working on these types of problems in that position.  In general the<br>DevOps team was there to ensure we got our customer up and thinking in terms of<br>DevOps paradigms - tearing down silos, system thinking, etc., and operating in<br>a DevOps manner using CI, CD, configuration management etc., etc. but in<br>general this had very little to working with massive systems at scale, and more<br>importantly to this discussion big data.  I love the DevOps culture and I see<br>it as a benefit to businesses who embrace it as well as the tech. workers who<br>work within this paradigm as it bridges two historically diametrically opposed<br>concepts automation and being human, i.e. culture in a manner that makes<br>working better.   Secondly I have a finite amount of energy and I want my work<br>to mean something at least to myself.  This is extremely subjective but data<br>science holds some profound answers to difficult questions, like global climate<br>change, poverty, and many other massive global problems, and DevOps while<br>transformative for both the worker and the organization doesn’t hold this<br>import.</p>
<p>There are at least two options to choose from about my immediate future.  They<br>are work as a DevOps engineer within an intensely big data focused corporation,<br>or work as a data scientist.  The first is almost within my grasp, and the<br>second is more alluring to me in the long run.  I think I’ve made up my mind<br>that I will move to data science but there is always that voice in my head that<br>tells me you already have a good thing why are you throwing the baby out with<br>the bath water.  I could very well see myself unemployed for a full year but<br>I also realize the demand for data scientists makes this fate unlikely.  I just<br>had the house built, and started to enjoy living in it but my career and what<br>I do in my life are ultimately more important than what or even where I live.<br>As I’ve defined myself I better reap my rewards.</p>

        <p>I’ve unfortunately, as is all too often the case, been lax in updating this<br>website, with no updates since June. Regardless of the cessation in writing I’m<br>more than ever determined to make my mark in data science.  For that reason I’m<br>so excited by the news I discovered today.  I learned today by doing a search<br>in Indeed for data science jobs in Austin that Galvanize is hiring a data<br>science instructor, </p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/galvanize/52ab0336-418a-4456-9930-8e854f22094f" target="_blank" rel="external">https://jobs.lever.co/galvanize/52ab0336-418a-4456-9930-8e854f22094f</a></p>
<p>Which naivly seemed to imply that Galvanize will be coming to Austin.  This is<br>the bootcamp company I planned to have to sell my current home, and move to<br>Seattle to experience.  A Google search later and this assessment was supported<br>by looking at their official blog, </p>
<p><a href="http://www.galvanize.com/blog/2015/08/12/galvanize-austin/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.galvanize.com/blog/2015/08/12/galvanize-austin/</a></p>
<p>Looking at the dates the greatest likelihood is that there will be a bootcamp<br>offered here at the beginning of February. Which if I have any say in the<br>matter I will attend. </p>
<p>I truly have grown to deeply appreciate Austin, and the idea of being able to<br>stay in this majestic city, while going through the necessary steps to garner<br>a data science job is truly exciting.  Like all things that are mostly a piece<br>of imagination and desire only time can show how much is truth, and how much<br>was day dreaming.  Regardless never stop reaching for your dreams and so life<br>moves on.</p>

        <p>This website contains my thought about data science, code, critical thinking,<br>culture, Yoga, gardening, meditation, doubt, and ideas of projects that I have<br>taken on during, and upon their completion.  Writing isn’t a panacea but<br>through an ordering of the complex, or subconscious it can often times remedy<br>maladies that plague the mind.  I write this in hopes that it will help in my<br>thought process, but I realize it has the potential to also inspire others who<br>are walking on a similar road as mine.  Exposing oneself is a gamble but as<br>life is finite the gamble is so to temporally limited, and as I have already<br>lived quite a good life it’s now time to make something of it.</p>
