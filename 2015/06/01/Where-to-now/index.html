        <h2 id="Retrospective,_expectations,_honesty_and_work">Retrospective, expectations, honesty and work</h2><p>A bit more than 6 months have past since I made the choice to part companies<br>with Rackspace.  It’s been a time of self reflection, examination, and<br>a reality check and while the outcome is different than I expected it’s time to<br>synthesize what I have learned and make the best choice given my goals, and<br>limitations.  To sum things up I got scared as I’m prone to do of commitment<br>and was not in the right state to make a rational decision when I left and well<br>it was a lesson if nothing else than in humility.  I can write all day how<br>I still think big data, and data science are and will become ever more so<br>a transformative tool but so is devops.  It’s not easy to write but through<br>observing how I actually want to spend my time, what I’ve concluded after<br>6 months of self observation is that I’m intrinsically better suited, and<br>therefore more capable at devops than data science.  Not only is this the case<br>but I enjoy the tasks of devops more than that of data science, building<br>a stable dynamic infrastructure over learning a new machine language algorithm.</p>
<p>I’m not irredeemably bad, at least in my own mind.  I no doubt have commitment<br>issues but I’ve stuck to things in the past, my MS degree, and 4 years of being<br>a professional system administrator/devops engineer, and well it’s time to<br>accept that I made a mistake six months ago, and pick myself up and start job<br>hunting again and I’m fine with night rotations but graveyard isn’t good for me<br>and I will be avoiding it if at all possible. I’ve updated my LinkedIn,<br>completed my Hired.com profile, and am actively starting to apply for<br>positions.</p>
<p>I guess I can throw in another wrench I’m looking for positions in the Los<br>Angeles area.  This will all sound a bit myopic but I’m an only child to<br>a healthy hardworking mid-seventies widower intellectual father who lives in<br>a largish house filled to the brim with boxes, no hot water, many small things<br>falling apart, and partially feral cats. All of my father’s close family is on<br>the East coast, or in Israel, other than myself in Austin. I’m just as<br>eccentric as he is but fixing his home up will at least make me breathe a bit<br>better knowing he has a better life. I also want to be closer to a large Jewish<br>population. I’m completely secular but regardless of my thoughts on Judaism or<br>how I choose to practice or not I’d like to once again be in an area that<br>doesn’t view my existence as something alien. I’ve done it for 5 years now and<br>I’ve had enough.</p>
<h2 id="When_I_decided_to_change_directions:">When I decided to change directions:</h2><p>So I gave notice that in two weeks I would resign from my position at Rackspace<br>two weeks ago.  I think it useful at this stage to provide what motivated me,<br>and where I plan to go now that the smoke has cleared.  First for the shock and<br>horror, I didn’t secure a job for myself prior to leaving.  Initially I wrote<br>a somewhat flowery piece about how I found my calling, and how this was somehow<br>a pinnacle of self achievement.  I think it’s important to be as honest as<br>possible regarding life changing decisions.  There were two areas that were<br>a deal breaker working at Rackspace.  The first was that I was working<br>graveyard shift.  For people who aren’t naturally night owls working these<br>hours is draining, and it only gets worse as time progresses.  A decreased<br>mental and physical state were scary to me.  </p>
<p>For my sanity I realized that working night shift wasn’t something I was<br>willing to do anymore.   In a bit over two and half years that I worked for<br>Rackspace I gained 30 pounds, lost muscle mass,  my stress relief changed from<br>a daily Yoga practice to drinking beer, and I no longer had the energy to learn<br>new skills and that was just unacceptable.  I also couldn’t participate in<br>group pursuits I had great interest in that fell outside of work not only<br>because most events overlapped with when I was sleeping or working but moreover<br>I simply didn’t have enough energy to participate in them.  Not to bring to the<br>surface all of my insecurities but I’m a mid-thirties something who is very<br>much a bachelor only half by choice.  Working those hours certainly doesn’t<br>help in my search for a partner in crime.  So romantically describing a desire<br>to move to data science doesn’t properly reflect the situation I found myself<br>in nor why I decided to resign.</p>
<p>I was given the opportunity by my manager, and I’m honestly truly thankful to<br>her for trusting in my character and skill set, of moving to a first shift job<br>at Rackspace in the same capacity as I had worked on third.  I love<br>collaborating to create technical solutions however there were several profound<br>limitations with this position.  First I love optimizing algorithms, finding<br>meaning from data, understanding what equations mean in a functional sense, and<br>the challenges, and rewards that working with big data provides.  There was no<br>way of working on these types of problems in that position.  In general the<br>DevOps team was there to ensure we got our customer up and thinking in terms of<br>DevOps paradigms - tearing down silos, system thinking, etc., and operating in<br>a DevOps manner using CI, CD, configuration management etc., etc. but in<br>general this had very little to working with massive systems at scale, and more<br>importantly to this discussion big data.  I love the DevOps culture and I see<br>it as a benefit to businesses who embrace it as well as the tech. workers who<br>work within this paradigm as it bridges two historically diametrically opposed<br>concepts automation and being human, i.e. culture in a manner that makes<br>working better.   Secondly I have a finite amount of energy and I want my work<br>to mean something at least to myself.  This is extremely subjective but data<br>science holds some profound answers to difficult questions, like global climate<br>change, poverty, and many other massive global problems, and DevOps while<br>transformative for both the worker and the organization doesn’t hold this<br>import.</p>
<p>There are at least two options to choose from about my immediate future.  They are work as a DevOps engineer within an intensely big data focused corporation, or work as a data scientist.  The first is almost within my grasp, and the second is more alluring to me in the long run.  I think I’ve made up my mind that I will move to data science but there is always that voice in my head that tells me you already have a good thing why are you throwing the baby out with the bath water.  I could very well see myself unemployed for a full year but I also realize the demand for data scientists makes this fate unlikely.  I just had the house built, and started to enjoy living in it but my career and what I do in my life are ultimately more important than what or even where I live.  As I’ve defined myself I better reap my rewards.</p>
